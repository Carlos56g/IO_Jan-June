# Investigacion de Operaciones
GitHub repository for the "Investigacion de Operaciones" class.  
This repository stores the differents activities and material assigned.

## Act 2: Modelado matemático - Problemas 4 y 5
Identify the parameters, decision variables, objective function, and constraints of 2 problems.
Also there is a python script for each problem that give us the answer of the model specified on the document
The script creates by itself a Virtual Environment with the required Libraries
The solution is obtained using the scipy.optimize library
**Act2**: [Mathematical model 4 & 5](https://github.com/Carlos56g/IO_Jan-June/tree/main/Actividad%202%20Modelado%204%2C5)

## Act 3: Modelado matemático - Problemas 1, 2 y 3
Identify the parameters, decision variables, objective function, and constraints of 3 problems.
Also there is a python script for each problem that give us the answer of the model specified on the document
The script creates by itself a Virtual Environment with the required Libraries
The solution is obtained using the scipy.optimize library
**Act3**: [Mathematical model 1,2,3](https://github.com/Carlos56g/IO_Jan-June/tree/main/Actividad%203%20Modelado%201%2C2%2C3)

## Act 4: Modelado matemático - Problemas 6, 7, 8 y 9
Identify the parameters, decision variables, objective function, and constraints of 4 problems.
Also there is a python script for problems (7,8,9) that give us the answer of the model specified on the document
There is no code for the problem 6.
The script creates by itself a Virtual Environment with the required Libraries
The solution is obtained using the pulp library
**Act4**: [Mathematical model 6,7,8,9](https://github.com/Carlos56g/IO_Jan-June/tree/main/Actividad%204%20Modelado%206%2C7%2C8%2C9)

## Act 6: Espacio muestral
The Random Variable X, represent the sum for the random experiment of rolling three 20-sided dices.  
The script creates by itself a Virtual Environment with the required Libraries
### Output
#### Frequency Table
The script generates a Frequency Table

#### Graph
And a Graph with that represents the probability distribution
